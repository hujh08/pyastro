Tools for astronomy

# Motivation

Main purpose of this package is to provide toolset for frequently encountered astronomy tasks, e.g. image plotting, background calculation, object masking.

Powerful astronomy packages already exist, like `astropy`, `photutils`. Extended tools are then developed as wrapper of functions in these modules, providing simpler way to use for encountered tasks.
